# Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone-Project-Cyclistic
Final project about the fictitious company called "Cyclistic", a bike sharing company from Chicago. To complete this analysis I used the "R" programming language and with this I was able to finish with the Google Data Analysis Professional Certification.
