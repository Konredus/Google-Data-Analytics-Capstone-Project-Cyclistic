Bike-Share Analysis

This analysis is an optional case study from the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate on Coursera.

# Introduction
This case study is the final project for the Google Data Analytics Certification Course. For this case study, I performed real-world tasks of a junior data analyst conducting analysis for a fictional company, Cyclistic, that has more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Data was collected from a real bike share company, Divvy.

# About The Company
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.

Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

# Scenario
As a Junior Data Analyst with experience in marketing analysis, I have had the opportunity to work with Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. Working alongside the director of marketing, I have been tasked with identifying key insights into the differences between casual riders and annual members, in order to optimize Cyclistic's marketing strategy and increase the number of annual memberships. Through my analytical approach, I have been able to identify key patterns and trends that have helped to inform our strategy moving forward.

To ensure the success of this project, I have developed professional data visualizations that effectively communicate my findings to key stakeholders. By presenting the data in a clear and accessible manner, I have been able to gain the support of Cyclistic executives, who have approved my recommendations based on the compelling insights presented in my visualizations.

My experience with Cyclistic has allowed me to develop a range of skills that I believe would be of value to any marketing team. As a data analyst, I have the ability to translate complex data sets into actionable insights, enabling organizations to make informed decisions that drive business success.
I am confident that my skills, combined with my passion for data analysis and marketing, would make me a valuable addition to any team.

# Key Stakeholders
Lily Moreno: The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels

# Business Task
The business task at hand is to understand the differences in usage patterns between annual members and casual riders of Cyclistic bikes, and to determine how Cyclistic can persuade casual riders to purchase annual memberships through the use of digital media.

Data Source
The data utilized for this analysis spans a one-year period from January 2022 to December 2022, and has been provided by Motivate International Inc. under license. 
The data is stored in separate CSV files, which are organized by month and can be accessed here.

# Conclusion
The data clearly shows a strong contrast in the usage patterns between Cyclistic subscribers and casual customers. While subscribers utilize the bikes as a primary mode of transportation, riding for shorter durations on a daily basis, customers use the service more for leisure, riding for longer durations on weekends. This insight can be used by Cyclistic to design targeted marketing campaigns and promotional offers to attract and retain these two different sets of customers. By understanding the unique needs and preferences of each group, Cyclistic can create tailored messaging that resonates with their respective target audiences and drives higher engagement and adoption of their service.

# Key Recommendations
To increase the number of annual memberships at Cyclistic, we propose a targeted marketing campaign that will appeal to both casual riders and annual members. Our plan includes placing advertisements at the top 20 bike stations where customers book from and at high-traffic areas in the city, such as popular work and dining locations. We will also create a fun and relatable social media skit that engages audiences of all ages, while running a short survey to gather valuable data on our target customers.

Given the data that shows customers using the bike share service more on weekends, we recommend offering a weekend-only subscription to encourage more usage and enjoyment of the service. We will also offer a special upgrade offer from weekend-only to annual subscription, to incentivize customers to subscribe for a full year. With this comprehensive marketing approach, we are confident that we can achieve our goal of increasing annual memberships and ensuring the long-term success of Cyclistic.
