----Step 2 / Prepare all the materials------
---------------------------------------------
1.To obtain the necessary data for this project, I will download the company's one-year database.

2.Once I have the database, I will closely examine its structure and content, paying particular attention to the information contained in each column. This will help me gain a comprehensive understanding of the data and ensure that I am able to use it effectively.

3.To organize the information in a structured and logical manner, I will prepare separate folders for each category of data, ensuring that each piece of information is placed in the appropriate folder. This will enable me to easily locate the information I need and ensure that the data is presented in a clear and accessible way.

----Step 3 / Process the data in R----
--------------------------------------
1.In R, I will import the data from the database and create a new project file.

2.I will perform data cleaning, which involves identifying and correcting errors or inconsistencies in the data, such as missing values or typos.

3.I will transform the data into a format that is suitable for analysis, such as creating new variables or summarizing data.

4.I will use R to visualize the data, such as creating graphs or charts that help me to identify patterns or trends in the data.
